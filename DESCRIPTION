Description: The price action at any given time is determined by investor 
  sentiment and market conditions. Although there is no established principle, 
  over a long period of time, things often move with a certain periodicity.
  This is sometimes referred to as anomaly. 
  The seasonPlot() function in this package calculates and visualizes the 
  average value of price movements over a year for any given period. 
  In addition, the monthly increase or decrease in price movement is 
  represented with a colored background. 
  This seasonPlot() function can use the same symbols as the 'quantmod' package 
  (e.g. ^IXIC, ^DJI, SPY, BTC-USD, and ETH-USD etc).
