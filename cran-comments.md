Dear Julia Haider

Thank you very much for your kind suggestion to the seasonalityPlot package.

According to your comments, I modified this package as follows;
(1) I re-wrote the description text.
(2) I added () behind all function names in the description texts
(3) I added single quotes for the package names.
(4) I unwraped the examples.

Best Regards,
Satoshi
